Micro-app frontend architecture examples and templates of various approaches
============================================================================

At this moment, this example consists of a few Angular projects demonstrating
an implementation of a main application called Envelope and micro applications
that can be attached not only at the build time (micro application as a _feature library_),
but above all, <ins>dynamically at runtime</ins> (external sources eg. CDN, dedicated gateway).

The business case used as an example here is Administration Panel for an E-commerce system.

Example consists of following projects:
- Envelope `/micro-frontend-envelope`: Starting application with layout and main navigation, 
acting as Envelope for other apps. That's entry layer for every nested content in panel,
- Orders `/micro-frontend-app-orders`: Demo micro application which acts as Orders section
  - Micro-app model where bundles can be hosted separately and referenced at runtime in Envelope app 
- (more coming soon) 

---
#### Assumptions

The quality of the micro application code shouldn't be drastically reduced
due to the adaptation to the technology used to attach micro applications to
the envelope application. Micro applications can't be (very) toughly coupled
to the technologies used only for attaching them to envelope. They should be
easy to rewrite to a traditional model in case of problems with architecture. 
Developing such apps shouldn't be a one-way ticket.

#### Potential use cases / Pros / Cons

- Multi-domain, big projects, especially if multiple teams are working on 
separate, complicated domains or are skilled in different technologies 
(Angular / React / Vue.js),
- Frequently changing website content, driven by A/B tests or AI decisions,
when replacement at runtime has more pros compared to building dedicated release bundles
and lets deliver features faster
- Web content management systems (CMSs/WCMSs)

Pros and cons differs depending on which exact micro-frontend model is used.
They are listed in concrete projects.

#### All technologies and tools used across projects

- Newest [Angular 8](https://angular.io/)
  - Going beyond typical use cases of [Angular Elements](https://angular.io/guide/elements)
  - Envelope and all micro applications compatible with [Lazy Loading Feature Modules](https://angular.io/guide/lazy-loading-ngmodules)
  - Extending Angular CLI with [ngx-build-plus](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/ngx-build-plus)
- [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)

#### Setup / Usage / How to

In every project:

```
npm install
```

Development of Envelope or any single micro application can be independent and easy as default:

```
npm run start
```

To run all together:

1. Build and host bundles of every micro app that you want to test:

    ```
    npm run build
    npm run server
    ``` 

2. Serve or build Envelope application:

    For development and live-reload:
    
    ```
    npm run start
    ```
    
    Production:
    
    ```
    npm run bundle
    npm run server 
    ```

### Fully functional Angular app as Web Component / Custom Element 

Can be hosted separately and referenced at runtime in Envelope app.

---
#### Technologies and tools used

- [Angular](https://angular.io/) with use of [Angular Elements](https://angular.io/guide/elements)
- [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)
- [ngx-build-plus](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/ngx-build-plus)

Current status:
- :heavy_check_mark: Angular 8
- :heavy_check_mark: Lazy loading
- :heavy_check_mark: Lightweight bundles, size of micro app reduced to minimum

- :heavy_check_mark: Angular router fully working (:grey_exclamation: with additional boilerplate)
- :x: Ivy compiler [[not supported yet]](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/30262#issuecomment-497101996)

---
#### Pros:

- Tiny, small projects where business cases / domains are separated
(let's say, some kind of microservices on frontend)
- Fast, independent builds and feature delivery
- Blazing fast deployment of micro applications,
- Much less conflicts comparing to one monolith app developed by multiple teams,
- Content not loaded, until used (lazy loading of micro applications / components,
  regardless of the technologies used inside),
- Easier to remove from the entire system, easier to transfer to another,
- Complexity of whole frontend project scales more horizontally instead of vertically 

#### Cons:

- Can be sometimes too coupled to Web Component / Angular Elements specifics,
- Boilerplate in every app to handle architecture and navigation
  (Angular Router is not ready for that case out of the box)
- Requires maintenance of additional Envelope app and shared services, guards etc.
  which is sometimes barely related to business cases, can be time-consuming
  and hard to debug,
- The less people work on the whole solution, the less it pays off,
- Too complex and over-designed solution if whole application and business
  cases are quite simple.

#### Setup / Usage / How to

###### Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4201/`.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
You can also test production setup running `npm run start:prod`

###### Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project.
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
Use `npm run build:gateway-model` if you are using some kind of gateway also 
for frontend assets and relative request path contexts are redirected 
deep into the infrastructure.

###### Serve production build statics

Run `npm run server`

###### Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

###### Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

#### Areas for improvements

- The less boilerplate and coupled to WC code the better
